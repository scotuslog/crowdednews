# The Crowded Newsroom
The Crowded Newsroom is a feeble attempt to create a crowdsourced newsroom. I honestly doubt anyone will do this, but what the hell.

The idea is that "we" take on stories. Then "we" research and write those stories.

For instance, the first story idea is about Mitch McConnell's last reelection victory. To build that story, "we" research McConnell's election wins. Read the coverage of McConnell's campaign. Interview people who worked for the campaign, or against the campaign. Interview people who study these sorts of elections and get their thoughts.

## Contribute
This is supposed to be a crowdsourced newsroom, so no one person is expected to do all of the work. Every little bit of work helps. Me writing this README is helpful. Someone else editing it to make it better, is being helpful. Even if you find one little bit of information that makes the story better, that is useful. 

To contribute, edit or create files in this repository. All stories exist in a directory. For example, the Mitch McConnell reelection story is in the directory mitch-election-2020. In each directory there can be any number of files, but the following are standard. 

* README.md - This is the "story." The research is crafted into this written story.
* RESEARCH.md - All of the research should be organized in this file.

Any assets, such as images or documents, such as PDFs, should exist in the root directory for the story. It's not nessary to create subdirectories.

## Research
Transparency is vital to credibility. Any and all information gathered should be made available to the public. There are obviously exceptions, for instance to protect someone's identity, or personal information not related to the story.

All research should include verifiable references. 

Interviews performed should be fully documented and transcribed. The transcription doesn't need to be of the entire interview, but the relevant sections should be trascribed verbatim. If an interview has been recorded, the complete interview audio should be uploaded in a reasonable audio quality.

Plagiarism is never OK.
