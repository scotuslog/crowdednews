# General Strike June 13, 2022
The people don't have a voice in this busted up democracy hanging by a thread in the United States. Is it the worst democracy ever? Probably not, but it's on life support right now. Both major political parties have taken a hard turn to the right. The Republicans have gone full-blown fascist. The Democrats are where the Republicans were 25 years ago. 

The problem with this situation is that on the issues, Americans are very progressive and liberal. People want good schools, clean water and a nice life. Not everyone wants to just grind out a meager existence picking up whatever scraps the elite toss in the trash. 

Nothing in this country happens without our labor. That is our most powerful weapon. Too many Americans have been brainwashed to believe that we should never use our labor to achieve political objectives. They're convinced that if we use our labor, like go on a strike, that we will destroy capitalism. Our economy would grind to a halt and businesses would all fail. Everyone would lose their jobs. People would be busting up furniture for firewood. 

But is our economy and capitalism that fragile? Would the capitalists hold strong? Would their will be greater than our will?

Politicians in DC need to pass bills or take action on the following:
* January 6 insurrectionists must be brought to justice. No more closed door meetings. Public hearings. Indictments.
* Voting Rights
* Women's Rights
* Climate Change
* End the filibuster

Our real power isn't our vote. Our real power is our labor. Let's use it.
